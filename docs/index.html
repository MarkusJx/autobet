                    The program provides various stats such as the current status, the time it is running since it was
                    last started, the money made all time, the money made this session and the current probability of
                    winning a bet.

                <p>
                    Autobet also ships with a web server for viewing stats on a different device (or even access
                    the stats from outside your network if you are willing to open the required port on your firewall).
                    From that web interface, you are able to see all stats as displayed in the program's ui.

                    Autobet is able to simulate a controller using vXbox if navigating the ui using the mouse is
                    not possible. You are also able to select the name of the executable to run the betting algorithms
                    of. These options exist to <a href="https://github.com/MarkusJx/autobet/issues/20" class="link">

                <p>
                    There are several options provided to customize the betting operation such as the time to sleep
                    between the button is pressed and released again or the time to sleep between mouse click.
                    These times can be configured independent for each the mouse and controller navigation strategies.

                    GTA Online Autobet was designed to earn GTA $ in Grand Theft Auto Online without using any glitches
                    or mods. <br> This is accomplished through using the Horse racing mechanics implemented with the
                    Casino DLC (Patch 1.47/1.48) <br> The program will bet on horses, depending if it is likely to win
                    and earn about 270 thousand GTA dollars per hour

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <div class="text-wrapper">
                    To achieve its goal, the program will take over your mouse to place bets on a individual
                    horse. For a horse to be betted on, there must be no horses with an even winning
                    probability.
                    <br> Furthermore, there should not be multiple horses with the same winning probability
                    higher than 10/1. If these criteria are met, a bet of 10.000 Chips will be placed and the
                    race will be started. Otherwise, 100 chips will
                    be placed on the first horse, to reload the winning probabilities. This must be done due to
                    changed rules in GTA Online Patch 1.50.
                    <br> <br> After ~34 seconds the race should be finished and the process starts again.
