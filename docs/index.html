                    <div class="description-text">
                        GTA Online Autobet was designed to earn GTA $ in Grand Theft Auto Online without using any
                        glitches or mods. <br/> This is accomplished through using the Horse racing mechanics
                        implemented with the Casino DLC (Patch 1.47/1.48)
                        <br/><br/> The program will bet on horses, depending if it is likely to win and earn
                        about 270 thousand GTA dollars per hour
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="heading">How it works</h2>
                    <div class="description-text">
                        To achieve its goal, the program will take over your mouse to place bets on a individual horse.
                        For a horse to be bet on, there must be no horses with an even winning probability. <br/>
                        Furthermore, there should not be multiple
                        horses with the same winning probability higher than 10/1. If these criteria are met,
                        a bet of 10.000 Chips will be placed and the race will be started. Otherwise, 100 chips will be
                        placed on the first horse, to reload the winning
                        probabilities. This must be done due to changed rules in GTA Online Patch 1.50.
                        <br/> <br/> After ~34 seconds the race should be finished and the process starts again.

                        If you encounter any issues using this program or have ideas how to improve it, you can
                        always open a GitHub issue to report a bug or request a feature. To report a problem, use the
                        <span class="code-background">debug</span> or the
                        <span class="code-background">debug:full</span> option in the ui. If debug:full is used,
                        a debugging zip on your desktop will be created.<br><b>It will include a log and some images,
                        which may contain personal information, so make sure to delete these images before
                        putting it into your issue.</b><br><br> There are also plenty of other options available,
                        such as a live log viewer, where you can see what the program is doing right now.
                        <br/><br/> If you are looking for logs, those can be found in your documents folder:

                        <br/><br/>Please note that only one log may be found in that directory as this log will
                        contain all messages when file logging was enabled. Therefore, it is not recommended to keep
                        file logging activated as the log file size
                        is not limited. Also note that the log file will be deleted after 7 days if nothing was written
                        to it in that last 7 days.

                    that web interface, you are able to see all stats as

                    If you want to change the behaviour of the program regarding when to place a bet, you can do this by
                    providing a custom betting function. These are written in javascript and can be edited using the
                    code editor from within the program. Using the editor,
                    you can create multiple implementations, name, test and select one of them to be used as the default
                    betting function. To get started, there is a

                    times can be configured independent for each the mouse and
